CMPE25-HW3 Problem 1 and Problem 2 for Homework 3.

Problem 1, desgined a 3 layer fully connected network to predict value of a house for sale. Assigned 90 to 10 ration splitting train and test set. Applied 1000 iterations for training.

Problem 2, created CNN expecting an 127 x 127 (RGB) image. Used zero padding since image size is 127 and need to create a 8x8 grid. Then had a total of 20 layers for the 20 parameters. Used 2 anchors.
